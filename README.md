# Packet Genie

Packet Genie is a simple packet capturing solution that implements a streaming REST API to orchestrate packet captures in a magical way.

## Why?

Have you ever wanted to stream live packet captures on multiple hosts? Ever just wanted to do that over HTTP(s) with a REST API to make it easy to do? 

### ðŸš§  Development Notice

This gem is still under development.

## Installation

    $ gem install packet_genie

## Usage

### Server

The Packet Genie server will stream packets on the host running the Packet Genie server. This allows you to perform a live, remote packet capture over HTTP(s).

```ruby
# Start server without SSL
PacketGenie.server.run!(ssl: false)
```

Then, easily start a packet capture with CURL ( for example ):

```shell
$ curl localhost:4567/packets
```
